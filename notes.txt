created folder bookstore
inside 2 folders frontend, backend
in backend npm init -y
inside package.json 
type= module
inside scripts
start: node index.js
dev : nodemon index.js

inside frontend
gitignore
readme.md

create config.js containing port number
inside index.js set basic app

for each url we need http route
default route is /
that's why a blank app has cannot get /

app.get('/',(req,res) => {
    res.send("Welcome to MERN stack tutorial"); // Default status is 200
    return res.status(234).send("Welcome to mern stack tutorial"); // setting status too
});


I was stuck in connecting to mongodb server setup
export const mongoDBURL = 
"mongodb+srv://ge84zon:WZnWHIqXyR5D7otP@base1.rkbpewi.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority";

Because I generated a new password to connect to db earlier 
when i used the login password obviously i got rejected
then i looked into yelpcamp


set post route

in postman
body
give a json file of key value pairs to mimic post forms (easy to test backend without creating form

//Middleware to parse req body
app.use(express.json());
Colt used app.use(express.urlencoded())

the timestamp included in Book model ensures the time of creation gets stored


Setup routes for 
Creating a book
Updating a book
Deleting a book
Viewing a book
Show all books


Refactoring Express Routes with Route folder 


Now refactoring the Express Routes with React routes
IF we have 8 models, each have 5 routes , then we write 40 routes ?

CORS Policy
Cross Origin Resource Sharing
Prevent unauthorized cross origin access to a resource or server
check origin,methods etc and allow or deny requests
So API requests from React get rejected by Node
To bypass install npm i cors
app.use(cors());
This allows requests from all oroigins, i.e URL
We can also allow origin from certain URLs only and that too only some methods


Creating React:
Luckily Vite is used

In bookstore folder
npm create vite@latest
folder name frontend, 
react and javascript

add tailwing css
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
This creates tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js files.
add  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
inside tailwind.config.js file.

In react src 
delete app.css
in index.css delete all and paste 
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

Download ES7+ extension in VS code for rafc to create new component

SPA and add react router dom
Single Page Application - application
our application would not be refreshed on page change

npm i react-router-dom
in main.jsx
import {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom'
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,

create  Home 
CreateBooks 
ShowBook 
 EditBook 
DeleteBook 
in pages folder for each page to be displayed

in app.jsx
we import pages and render for each path
import {Routes, Route} from 'react-router-dom'
import Home from './pages/Home';
import CreateBooks from './pages/CreateBooks';
import ShowBook from './pages/ShowBook';
import EditBook from './pages/EditBook';
import DeleteBook from './pages/DeleteBook';

      <Routes>
        <Route path='/' element = {<Home} />
        <Route path='/books/create' element = {<CreateBooks} />
        <Route path='/books/details/:id' element = {<ShowBook} />
        <Route path='/books/edit/:id' element = {<EditBook} />
        <Route path='/books/delete/:id' element = {DeleteBook} />
      </Routes>

For HTTP Requests install axios and icons for Icons
npm i axios react-icons
